Entries (this was just for practice)
Users - the users of my app. Contains basic info (username, password, email)
Groups - groups of users. I plan on allowing users be able to form groups of their choosing for the app. Groups have a title.
Events - user created events, users will be able to create events and invite multiple people to them. 

User_events - This is what links users to events in a many to many relationship. has_many :through
Groupings - This is what links users to groups in a many to many relationship has_many :through
